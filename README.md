NeoClock
========

By now everyone's probably seen Bram Knapen's [Equinox Clock](http://www.bramknaapen.com/?p=549) 
and plenty of people have preceded me in making their version of an RGB clock. Ever since seeing it
I've wanted to build something similar too, but somehow never got around to it. When I recently came
across Adafruit's 60 LEDs/meter Neopixels it suddenly clicked, hence this project.
